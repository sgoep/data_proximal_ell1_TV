Matlab Code for Feature reconstruction from sparse tomographic data. In particular, this code is used in the paper

Data-proximal complementary â„“1-TV reconstruction forlimited data CT, 
[https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2304.11599](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2304.11599)

Note that the parameters set in the code to **NOT** produce the reconstruction shown in the paper. The repository is currently reworked where I plan to clean the code and add comments.
